# Deep Neural Networks applied to Titanic dataset using TensorFlow's Datasets and Estimators

Aim of this work is to implement DNNs for Kaggle's Titanic dataset using TensorFlow's [Datasets and Estimators](https://developers.googleblog.com/2017/09/introducing-tensorflow-datasets.html).

With TensorFlow 1.4, the Dataset API is introduced. The real advantage of the Dataset API is that a lot of memory management is done for the user when using large file-based datasets. And, in this work, we will be implementing a predefined DNN estimator and feed it with the Dataset API for Kaggle's Titanic dataset.
